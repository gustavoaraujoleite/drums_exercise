This basic project was made along with B7Web instructor during one of the classes.

The main idea is that the main page has 9 buttons and you are able to access each one of them through your keyboard. It does not work by clicling in it.
Its main goal is to listen to the different sounds of the drums by clicking in those buttons, and be able to play it.
You can also write your own pattern in the input area, including space between the digits for the rests, and hit the PLAY button to auto play for you.
